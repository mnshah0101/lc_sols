## Configuration

The dashboard uses a simple JSON configuration file that's easy to edit and maintain:

### Config File: `src/data/leetcode-config.json`

```json
{
  "profile": {
    "username": "your-username",
    "startDate": "2024-01-01",
    "goal": {
      "problemsPerDay": 2,
      "totalProblems": 365
    }
  },
  "problems": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Two Sum",
      "difficulty": "Easy",
      "topic": "Array",
      "subtopic": "Hash Table",
      "dateSolved": "2024-01-01",

      "notes": "Classic problem using hash map"
    }
  ],
  "topics": [
    {
      "name": "Array",
      "totalProblems": 150,
      "completedProblems": 45,
      "priority": "high",
      "subtopics": [
        { "name": "Two Pointers", "completed": 12, "total": 25 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Adding New Problems

To add a new problem, simply append to the `problems` array:
